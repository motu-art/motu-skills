# MotuArt Color Engine — crop specs overview (M16 purpose crop)

The live catalog is authoritative — run `scripts/crop-specs.sh` (or `GET
/v1/crop/specs`) to list current ids/sizes. This is a quick orientation to the
three categories and the shipping specs.

## Three categories

- **id_photo** — official ID/passport/visa/license photo standards. Fixed pixel size
  + physical `width_mm`/`height_mm` + `dpi` (embedded on save, so exports print at the
  right physical size). Most declare a `bg_colors` palette for background replacement
  (换底) since these documents require a specific solid background. ID-photo specs may
  also include `compliance`, `upload`, and `print` metadata used by `id-pack`,
  `id-check`, upload optimization, and print-sheet layout.
- **portrait** — professional/editorial portrait framings (headshot to full body).
  Pixel-only, no print standard, no background palette (original background kept).
- **avatar** — square social-avatar framing. Pixel-only, no background palette.

Pass only a `spec` id — the engine auto-detects the face/head and positions it to
that spec's `head_ratio` (crown-to-chin as a fraction of output height) and margins;
you never draw a crop box by hand.

| id | Use | Size | head_ratio |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `avatar_1x1` | Square social avatar (WeChat/DingTalk/general) | 800×800px | 0.45 |

## Background replacement (换底)

Only `id_photo` specs declare a `bg_colors` palette (e.g. `{"white": "#FFFFFF",
"blue": "#438EDB", "light_blue": "#D6EAF8", "red": "#FF0000"}` for the CN sizes). Pass a palette name, `default`
(the spec's standard choice), or an explicit `#RRGGBB` as `bg_color` — an
unrecognized name is rejected (the palette *is* the compliance rule for these
documents). Background swap runs a portrait-matting pass on the crop window at source
resolution, so hair/ear edges stay clean (no crude-cutout fringe).

## Framing guarantee

Cropping only repositions the frame (head ratio + margins) — it never stretches or
compresses facial proportions. Wide framings (`half_body_2x3`, `three_quarter_2x3`,
`full_body_9x16`) require the source photo to actually contain that much of the body;
the engine pads (edge-replicate or `pad_color`) rather than invent missing content.
